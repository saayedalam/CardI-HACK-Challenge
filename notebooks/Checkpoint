Features

SEVERITY: clinical_features + ["Variant.Pathogene"]

MACE: clinical_features + ["Variant.Pathogene", "PRS_MACE_K50"]

PRS

SNP ranking: correlations computed on train only

PRS_MACE_K50 = weighted sum of per-dataset z-scored SNPs (train z-scored by train stats; test by test stats)

Models

SEVERITY: LightGBM (n_estimators=300, lr=0.05, random_state=42) → isotonic calibration with StratifiedKFold(5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)

MACE: LightGBM (n_estimators=300, lr=0.05, class_weight={0:1,1:3,2:4}, random_state=42)
